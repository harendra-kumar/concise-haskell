Haskell in a nutshell
=====================

A concise Haskell reference.

* Why haskell
* Haskell overview
  * Program structure (branching, functions)
* Semantics
* Basic syntax (branching, function, data)
* Type theory
* Functions
* Types
* Typeclasses
* Polymorphism
* Functor family
* Abstractions

  * Algebra
  * Category theory
* Basic abstractions
* Advanced abstractions
* Basic data structures
* Advanced data structures
* Packages
* Inside haskell
* Full syntax cheatsheet?
* Full vocabulary index
* Learning resources
* Other resources


- develop intuition about concepts
- learn the intuition via concise examples
- associated programs - a learning system for beginners
- reinforce the concepts that you learnt in a systematic manner
- develop the big picture

---------

By defining all the necessary vocabulary in a succinct manner it also allows
you to read any documentation on Haskell with ease, or just to refer to this
book whenever you need it..

---------

This is for learners trying to learn Haskell to do useful stuff.
No academic rigor, preciseness etc. Only to help an engineer do his job.

---------

This is a reference for intermediate level programmers who are out of the
beginner phase but are not experts. I believe this forms the majority of
programmers. This is for mere mortal programmers and not for PHDs.

This is a reference as well as a way to put your randomly acquired knowledge in
a more coherent bigger picture.

It tries to be a comprehensive reference to GHC Haskell condensed in a small
form which is easy to refer to. All related concepts are at one place to
provide a big picture quickly. I found the user manual too pedantic and noisy
and scattered for a programmer who needs relevant information quickly to be
able to use the concept or syntax rather than going into too many details about
the rationale, theoretical fundamentals, background or pedagogic terminology.
The terminology is kept where the terms are important and those terms are
defined briefly before use.

Contributions
-------------

Contributions are welcome! You can also contribute by raising issues including
specific questions or areas which are difficult or mind twisting to understand
in Haskell. This will help us improve the coverage of those areas or addressing
those questions in a better way with graphics, examples or better explanation.
